title : Impact of Buzzwords

So today I want to tell a short anecdote about how marketing and the buzzword-hungry press affect our economy in very specific instances.

Yesterday I was visited by two men representing a small local company that offers "engineering services for simulation-supported execution of complex tasks". Really advanced stuff. Their work include lots of simulations, that are visualized in 3D-models. So they came to my ivory tower to learn, whether or not this whole "virtual reality" stuff based on the Oculus Rift can be used as a Demonstrator for these models. The answer was no.

They told me that the hype around virtual reality nearly had them buying a DK2, just to see how it works. In this case, someone in the company somehow knew that our institute had those Oculus Rifts laying around so they asked my professor if they could get a demo. I showed them the [ViewPort Architectural Visualization](https://share.oculus.com/app/viewport-architectural-visualization) on our DK2, which looks and works quite well - but the shortcomings became obvious very quick.

To conclude my rambling: all those articles raving about how VR is "the future" lead to companies wasting money on glorified prototypes. We should all pay more attention to what is information and what is marketing. And curb our enthusiasm.
