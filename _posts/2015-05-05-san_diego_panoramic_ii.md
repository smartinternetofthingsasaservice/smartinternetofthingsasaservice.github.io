The other day I was overhearing a conversation among tourists about a place called [Sunset Cliffs](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Sunset+Cliffs,+San+Diego,+CA,+USA/@32.7272871,-117.2509865,1881m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x80deabcf1ef85a99:0x84d5574e08697c16!6m1!1e1). Going to the Pacific was on my list anyway and this location seemed perfect so I went for a hike.

The bus was only taking me this far and I had to walk for a while through residential area. The sun was burning and I was completely unprepared -- no sun-lotion, no water, no shades. It didn't bug me first as I figured to buy all these items along the way. Well, no. I experienced a super-rigid urban zoning scheme in San Diego. Commercial means *just* commercial, no housing. Likewise residential means no shops, not even a small corner store. Eventually I found a gas station to care for my basic needs but until then the experience of seeing the Pacific for the first time was making me forget my burns and dry throat.

*Nice houses and lot's of sun everywhere...*

*... and I haven't seen a single solar panel.*

*This was before I found water, sun-lotion and shades. I didn't care at that moment though.*
